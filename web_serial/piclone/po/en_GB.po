"\n"
"This is an application to copy and back up SD cards. To use it, you will "
"need a USB SD card writer.\n"
"\n"
"To back up your Raspberry Pi's internal SD card, insert a blank SD card into "
"a USB card writer and connect it to your Pi. Then start the application, "
"choose your card writer from the “Copy To Device” drop-down box and press "
"“Start”. The copy process will take 10-15 minutes depending on the size of "
"your card.\n"
"\n"
"The resulting card should be a bootable copy of your existing card; to "
"restore, simply place the backup card into the onboard SD card slot, put the "
"card to restore onto into the USB writer and repeat the copy process above.\n"
"\n"
"You can also back up to a standard USB stick, and then restore from the USB "
"stick to an SD card by setting the “Copy From Device” drop-down to the USB "
"stick and the “Copy To Device” to a USB card writer containing the card to "
"restore onto.\n"
"\n"
"Note that you cannot copy onto the SD card from which your Pi is currently "
"booted, which is why it does not appear in the “Copy To Device” dropdown.\n"
"\n"
"Note also that the destination card doesn’t need to be the same size as the "
"source card, but it must have enough space to hold all the data that is on "
"it. The application will warn you if there is insufficient space on the "
"destination.\n"
"\n"
"Under Raspbian Stretch and later versions, you cannot mount two partitions "
"with the same UUID, so you will not be able to mount a cloned SD card when "
"booted from the disk from which it was cloned. If you need to do this, "
"check the \"New Partition UUIDs\" box before copying.\n"
